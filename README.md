#### **Rowhammer**
Rowhammer is a security vulnerability that can be exploited to corrupt data or gain unauthorized access to a system. It is caused by the close physical proximity of DRAM memory cells. When a memory cell is activated, it can leak charge to neighboring cells, which can cause them to flip their state.

Rowhammer attacks can be triggered by repeatedly accessing the same memory row. The more times a row is accessed, the more likely it is that a bit flip will occur.

Rowhammer attacks have been demonstrated to be capable of flipping bits in memory, which can be used to corrupt data, modify code, or even gain unauthorized access to a system. In 2017, a team of researchers from Google Project Zero demonstrated a Rowhammer attack that could be used to elevate privileges on a system, allowing an attacker to gain root access.

There are a number of mitigations that can be used to protect against Rowhammer attacks, including:

Using ECC memory, which can detect and correct bit flips.
Enabling row hammer protection, which is a feature that some DRAM modules support.
Avoiding memory access patterns that are known to trigger Rowhammer attacks.
Rowhammer is a serious security vulnerability that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to a system. It is important to be aware of the risks posed by Rowhammer and to take steps to mitigate them.

#### **How to avoid Rowhammer**
There are a number of steps that can be taken to avoid Rowhammer attacks, including:

* Using ECC memory. ECC memory can detect and correct bit flips, which can help to prevent Rowhammer attacks.
* Enabling row hammer protection. Some DRAM modules support row hammer protection, which can help to prevent Rowhammer attacks.
* Avoiding memory access patterns that are known to trigger Rowhammer attacks. There are a number of memory access patterns that are known to trigger Rowhammer attacks. Avoiding these patterns can help to prevent Rowhammer attacks.
It is important to note that there is no silver bullet for preventing Rowhammer attacks. However, by taking the steps outlined above, it is possible to significantly reduce the risk of being exploited by a Rowhammer attack.
